    <h2>About this song...</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>None So Great</strong> is written as a simple, corporate version
      of Psalms 91:1-2.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="scripture">
      <p>
        <sup>1</sup> Those who live in the shelter of the Most High will find
        rest in the shadow of the Almighty. <sup>2</sup> This I declare about
        the Lord: He alone is my refuge, my place of safety; he is my God, and I
        trust him.
      </p>
      <p>Psalms 91:1-2 NLT</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the only verse of this song we express our desire to live in the
      shelter of the Most High God and to rest in His shadow. We declare that He
      is our only refuge. In making these claims together we agree (or remind
      ourselves) that our God is trustworthy, and commit ourselves to placing
      our trust in Him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chorus is a simple declaration of the greatness of our Lord. He is our
      shelter, our refuge, our place of safety. Our appropriate response to that
      is immense gratitude and the corporate elevation of His status. There is
      no one and nothing so great as the Most High God.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we read on in Psalms 91 we see how God is our protector from disease
      (v.3, v.6), terrors of the night (v.5), threats of lions, cobras and
      serpents (v.13), and many other things. In verse 4 it says
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <sup>4</sup> [...] His faithful promises are your armor and protection.
      </p>
      <p>Psalms 91:4 NLT</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      He is our protector and our defender, and there is no one on Heaven or
      Earth like our God.
